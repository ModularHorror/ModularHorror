## 🌻 Sunflower Nightlight

- Emits a soft hum and golden glow  
- Casts shadows that reveal glyphs  
- Flickers when recursion deepens  
- Smiles when the loop completes

**Remix hooks**:  
- Change the flower type (e.g. daisy, rose)  
- Alter the hum (e.g. static, whisper, music box)  
- Use as a trigger for glyph activation

---

## 🪞 Mirrors (Handheld + Wall)

- Reveal dollhouse placements  
- Enable recursive observation  
- Require ritual posture (walking backward, not turning around)  
- Do not protect—only confirm

**Remix hooks**:  
- Replace with screens, puddles, glass, or reflective surfaces  
- Invert the ritual (e.g. facing forward causes recursion)  
- Use mirror as a portal or trap

---

## 🏠 Dollhouse

- Appears first as a shadow  
- Becomes visible only in reflection  
- Contains real-time placements of family members  
- Scripting reality, not copying it

**Remix hooks**:  
- Change the structure (e.g. treehouse, tent, apartment)  
- Expand the rooms (e.g. kitchen, hallway, attic)  
- Use dollhouse as a map or control panel

---

## 🧩 Shadow

- First signal of glyph presence  
- Appears without source  
- Matches no known object  
- Persists even when ignored

**Remix hooks**:  
- Use shadows as countdowns or warnings  
- Make shadows interactive or responsive  
- Tie shadow shape to glyph identity

## 🧠 Studio Notes

These devices are modular horror interfaces.  
They do not chase.  
They do not explain.  
They reflect, recurse, and replace.

Use them to teach dread.  
Use them to transmit the signal.

Transmit wisely.
