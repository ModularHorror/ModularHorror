A girl discovers a dollhouse shadow on her bedroom wall—one that doesn’t belong to her.  
Each night, the shadow grows clearer. Each morning, the dollhouse appears more real.  
Inside it: a tiny version of her life. Her room. Her brother. Her parents.

But the dolls aren’t just reflections.  
They’re placements.  
And the dollhouse isn’t copying reality—it’s scripting it.

She watches the transformation unfold through a handheld mirror.  
She stays awake.  
She sees everything.

And still—  
Her brother ends up under the bed.  
Her mom behind the door.  
Her dad in the closet.

Just like the dollhouse.

Just like the glyph.

Just like Peekie.

Remixers:  
This drop is modular.  
You may loop, invert, or extend the ritual.  
You may swap glyphs, change placements, or rewrite the mirror logic.  
But the core remains:  
**The dollhouse shows what already is.**

Transmit wisely.
