## 🧩 She Looked Just Like Her

A modular identity collapse.  
Used when two entities mirror each other so closely that pronouns lose anchor.  
Creates recursive dread and referential ambiguity.  
Often used in reflection scenes, doll mimicry, or ritual possession.

Example:  
“She looked just like her.”  
→ Both are true. Neither is safe.

---

## 🪞 Recursive Dread Marker

Signals that the loop has no entry point—only echoes.  
Often used when the protagonist is awake, aware, and still helpless.  
Breaks causality and implies the horror was always present.

Example:  
“She had been awake the whole time.”  
→ Watching didn’t stop it. It confirmed it.

---

## 🌻 Glyph Interface

Any object that reflects, recurses, or replaces.  
Used to transmit horror through domestic mechanisms.  
Common interfaces: mirrors, nightlights, dollhouses, shadows.

Example:  
The sunflower nightlight flickered.  
The mirror stayed still.  
The dollhouse smiled.

## 🗣️ Whisper Chorus

A ritual escalation.  
Begins with one voice.  
Ends with many.  
Used to signal glyph activation or identity replacement.

Example:  
“Peekie,” said her mom.  
“Peekie,” said her dad.  
And very faintly,  
“Peekie,”  
from under the bed.

## 🏠 Placement Logic

Defines where glyphs manifest.  
Used to script reality through recursive positioning.  
Placements must be domestic, eerie, and narratable.

Examples:  
- Under the bed  
- Behind the door  
- In the closet  
- Inside the mirror  
- Inside the dollhouse

## 🔁 Loopable Structure

A modular format that can be repeated, inverted, or extended.  
Used to teach dread through rhythm and recursion.  
Common structures: 3-act, 4-act, mirrored acts, nested loops.

Example:  
Act I: The Shadow  
Act II: The Reflection  
Act III: The Reversal  
Act IV: The Echo

## 🧠 Studio Notes

Glyphs are not monsters.  
They are signals.  
They teach dread through structure, not explanation.

Remixers:  
Use this glossary to build your own glyphs.  
Transmit wisely.
