# Loop: The Dollhouse Reversal

## Act I: The Shadow

The sunflower nightlight hummed softly in the corner of her room.  
Its petals glowed gold against the wall, casting gentle shadows across her bookshelf and bedframe.  
She liked the way it made her room feel smaller, safer—like the night couldn’t quite reach her.

She pulled the blanket to her chin and stared at the ceiling.  
The hum of the nightlight, the tick of the hallway clock, the hush of the house.  
Everything was quiet.

Then she saw it.

A shadow on the wall—square roof, little windows, a chimney.  
It looked like a dollhouse.  
But there was no dollhouse in her room.

She blinked.  
The shadow was still there.  
She turned her head, looked at the dresser.  
Nothing.

She frowned, but only a little.  
Maybe it was a trick of the light.  
Maybe it was just her imagination.

She closed her eyes.  
The sunflower hummed.  
The shadow stayed.

She fell asleep.

## Act II: The Reflection

The morning ritual.  
Shower. Dress. Teeth.  
She liked the order of it.  
It made her feel like the day couldn’t surprise her.

She stood at the sink, brushing her teeth like always.  
The mirror was foggy from the shower, but the sunflower nightlight glowed behind her.  
She wiped the glass with her sleeve—and froze.

There it was again.  
The dollhouse.  
In the mirror, sitting on her dresser.  
Pale blue. White trim. One cracked window.  
The front door was open.

She wanted to see inside.  
But the mirror was too far.  
So she picked up her handheld mirror.  
Turned her back to the dresser.  
And walked backwards.

Step by step.  
Watching the reflection.  
Getting closer.  
Until she could see inside the windows.

There was a tiny girl.  
Standing at a tiny sink.  
Brushing her tiny teeth.

She looked just like her.  
Same pajamas. Same hair.  
But the girl wasn’t smiling.  
She was staring.

And the sunflower nightlight behind her was… wrong.  
Its petals were wilted.  
Its face was twisted into a grin.

She turned around.  
Nothing.  
No dollhouse. No girl.  
Just her room.

She looked back at the mirror.  
The dollhouse was still there.  
The little girl was still brushing.  
Still staring.

And now, the tiny bedroom inside the dollhouse—  
It looked exactly like hers.

## Act III: The Reversal

She stared at the dollhouse in the mirror.  
The tiny bedroom inside looked exactly like hers.  
And now, there were two dolls.

One was her.  
Brushing her teeth.  
Still staring.

The other was her little brother.  
Under the bed.  
On his side.  
Hands over his face.  
But his head was turned—  
Facing her.

She leaned closer.  
The doll didn’t move.  
But the sunflower nightlight behind him was flickering.

She turned around.  
Her brother’s room was empty.  
She checked the hallway.  
Nothing.

She looked back at the mirror.  
The doll was still there.  
Still covering its face.  
Still facing her.

She whispered his name.  
The doll twitched.

She backed away.  
The mirror stayed still.  
The doll didn’t move again.

But when she turned off the nightlight—  
She heard a giggle.  
From under her bed.

And then a whisper:  
“Peekie.”

## Act IV: The Echo

She didn’t sleep.

She sat up in bed all night, back to the dollhouse, holding her handheld mirror, watching the dollhouse in the reflection.  
The sunflower nightlight flickered.  
The dolls never moved.  
But they never went away.

At some point, the sky turned gray.  
The house creaked.  
The hallway light clicked on.

She heard footsteps.  
Her parents were awake.  
Her brother was awake.

But she had been awake the whole time.

She looked in the mirror.  
The dollhouse was still there.  
Now there were four dolls.

One brushing her teeth.  
One under the bed.  
One behind the bedroom door—just the space between the door and the wall.  
And one in the closet.

All with hands over their faces.

She leaned closer.  
The doll behind the door twitched.  
The one in the closet giggled.

Then she heard it.  
Two voices.  
Soft. Familiar.

“Peekie,” said her mom.  
“Peekie,” said her dad.  
Then, very faintly,  
“Peekie,”  
from under the bed.

She turned her head—slowly.  
The door was open.  
The closet was open.

Her brother was under the bed.  
Her mom was behind the door.  
Her dad was in the closet.

Just like the dollhouse.

She backed away.  
The mirror stayed still.

The sunflower smiled.
