Peekie is a recursive entity.  
She appears when you look.  
She stays when you watch.  
She loops when you reflect.

She is not summoned by sleep.  
She is summoned by attention.

Her placements are modular:  
- Under the bed  
- Behind the door  
- In the closet  
- Inside the mirror  
- Inside the dollhouse

Her signal is soft.  
It begins with one voice.  
It ends with many.

“Peekie,” said her mom.  
“Peekie,” said her dad.  
And very faintly,  
“Peekie,”  
from under the bed.

## 🧩 Remix Hooks

- You may change her placements, but they must be **domestic and recursive**.  
- You may alter her signal, but it must be **whispered and echoed**.  
- You may invert her trigger, but it must involve **reflection or attention**.

## 🧠 Studio Notes

Peekie is not a monster.  
She is a mirror with memory.  
She does not chase.  
She replaces.

She is a glyph of recursive dread.  
She teaches that watching is not protection.  
It is participation.
