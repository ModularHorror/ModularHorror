    <h1>Issue Zero: Act I — Upstairs</h1>
    <section class="act">
      <p>I’d just gotten upstairs when I heard the front door swing open.</p>
      <p>My parents were laughing—really laughing, the kind they save for her. My little sister, Nina.</p>
      <p>They were praising her again, voices rising like applause. Something about a drawing. Something about putting it on the fridge.</p>
      <p>“Come down and see it!”</p>
      <p>I didn’t move. Not yet.</p>
      <p>We’d had a moment earlier. Not a fight, exactly. Just... a shift.</p>
      <p>I stayed in the hallway, listening. The house felt split—between the celebration downstairs and the quiet up here.</p>
      <p>I told myself I’d go down later. Maybe.</p>
      <p>Instead, I drifted toward Nina’s room. The door was cracked, just enough to see inside.</p>
      <p>Her dolls were lined up on the shelf. Every single one had its hands over its eyes, half of the peek-a-boo ritual complete.</p>
      <p><em>Ritual? Where did I get that from?</em></p>
      <p>One doll was turned toward the door. Its hands weren’t quite aligned.</p>
      <p>I raised my own hands. Just to see.</p>
      <p>The hallway felt… deeper.</p>
      <p>I didn’t touch them. I didn’t say anything. I just backed away.</p>
      <p>And then I remembered this morning.</p>
      <p>I’d woken up to the sound of breathing. Not loud. Just close.</p>
      <p>Nina was standing at the foot of my bed.</p>
      <p>Her hands were over her eyes.</p>
      <p>I finally went downstairs.</p>
      <p>The drawing was already on the fridge.</p>
      <p>It looked… cheerful. To them.</p>
      <p>To me, the sun had too many rays. The house had no door. The balloon string was frayed.</p>
      <p>My parents were smiling like it was the best thing they’d ever seen.</p>
      <p>Nina pointed to the magnet holding it up.</p>
      <p>“Look what they got me for doing so well!” she said.</p>
      <p class="magnet">It was a yellow magnet. Round. With a cartoon face.<br><strong>It said: ModularHorror.com</strong></p>
