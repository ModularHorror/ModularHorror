# Modular Horror

Welcome to **Modular Horror**, a creative studio for scalable dread.

We publish weekly horror drops built from modular components—designed for narration, remixing, and live collaboration. This repository contains the anatomy of horror: engineered prompts, narrative loops, psychological devices, and evocative fragments.

## 🧩 Format

Each drop includes:

- **Prompt** — The seed of fear  
- **Loop** — A repeating structure or motif  
- **Device** — A mechanism of horror (e.g., reversal, echo, distortion)  
- **Fragment** — A narratable moment or scene  

These components are designed to be permuted, performed, and repurposed across genres and formats.

## 🎙️ Studio Philosophy

Modular Horror is built on:

- **Elegance** — Precision in language, structure, and delivery  
- **Modularity** — Scalable frameworks for horror, sci-fi, fantasy, and education  
- **Generosity** — Open-source tools, transparent workflows, and remixable content  
- **Atmosphere** — Literary depth, psychological tension, and sonic dread  

We believe horror is a signal—one that echoes across minds, formats, and time.
